The functions aim to provide a way a reuseable way to process and visualize scRNA data using Scanpy according to the requirements and parameters of the user.
- "main_complete.ipyb" provides a notebook file for sequential code
- "main_python.py" provides a python file of "main_complete.ipynb"


Packages used can be found on "requirements.txt" and can be loaded via pip


To Run Program Examples:
- Install packages with "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Run all cells in main_complete.ipynb
